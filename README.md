## Introduction
*Jobonja* is a job portal website that allows users to create profiles, post job listings, search for jobs, and apply to job openings. This project consists of two parts, the frontend and the backend. The frontend is built using **Next.js** and **Bootstrap**, while the backend is developed using **Django Rest Framework**, **JWT**, and **PostgreSQL**.

## Getting Started
### Frontend
To get started with the frontend, you need to have **Node.js** and **npm** installed on your machine. After cloning the repository, run the command `npm install` to install the required packages. You can start the development server by running `npm run dev`. This will start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`.

### Backend
To use the backend, you need to have **Python 3.x** and **PostgreSQL** installed. After cloning the repository, create a virtual environment, activate it, and install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Next, create a PostgreSQL database, migrate the database schema, and create a superuser account. Finally, run the Django server using `python manage.py runserver`. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin` to access the Django admin panel.

To access the Jobonja website API endpoints, use a REST client like Postman.

## Features
The frontend of Jobonja has the following features:

- **User authentication:** Users can sign up and log in to their accounts.
- **Job search:** Users can search for jobs based on keywords and filter them based on job types.
- **Job listing:** Users can view a list of jobs based on their search criteria.
- **Job details:** Users can view the details of a job, including the job description, requirements, and application instructions.

The backend of Jobonja provides a RESTful API that can be used to create, read, update, and delete job listings and user profiles.
